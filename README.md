# IntegrationPlus Workspace

This repository provides a minimal SwiftPM based workspace for the **Integration Plus** prototype.

## Structure
- `DesignSystem` – empty Swift package placeholder
- `AppShell` – empty Swift package placeholder
- `IntegrationPlusApp` – iOS application package using SwiftUI and depending on the two local packages. The main screen hosts placeholders for the Sprachtool, Skill Exchange and Bureaucracy modules.

Open `IntegrationPlusApp/Package.swift` with Xcode 15 or later to build the app.
